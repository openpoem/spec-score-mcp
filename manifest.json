  "long_description": "Spec Score scores your specs on 4 axes (completeness, clarity, constraints, specificity) before you feed them to an LLM. Balance matters more than individual scores — a spec scoring 0.50 on all axes produces better output than one scoring 0.95/0.95/0.20/0.90. The weak axis is where the LLM will improvise. Three tools: spec_score (JSON scoring with verdict), spec_visualize (SVG radar chart), and spec_compare (side-by-side comparison).",
